This repo provides data and subsequent model for the paper "Dataset Reuse: Translating Principles to Practice"

This includes:

* data for all github repos containing datasets. (download_github_dataset.sh)
* data used for training models (download_processed_datasets.sh)
* The source code for model training (under reuse_predictor). Our model uses pytorch.
